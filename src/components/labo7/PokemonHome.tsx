            Hello there! Welcome to the world of POKEMON!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My name is OAK! People call me the POKEMON PROF!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This world is inhabited by creatures called POKEMON!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            For some people, POKEMON are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself... I study POKEMON as a profession.
